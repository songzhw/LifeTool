38
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,360
我刚刚瞟到了机长
Hey -- I just caught a glimpse of our pilot,

39
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,350
他长得和萨利机长一模一样
and he looks exactly like Sully.

40
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,190
{\an8}美国英雄机长  他的故事在2016年还翻拍了电影

41
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,190
我觉得就是萨利机长本人
I-I think it is Sully.

42
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,420
我记得机长好像是个女的
I think that's a woman.

43
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,770
-才不是  -是的
- No, it's a -- ‭- Yeah.

44
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,460
我知道你的小算盘
Oh, I know what you're doing,

45
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,490
你在测试我有多支持女权主义
you're testing the limits of my feminism.

46
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,900
告诉你吧
I will have you know that

47
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,010
我完全能接受我的生命
I am perfectly fine putting my life in the hands

48
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,420
掌握在女性飞行员手中
of a female pilot.

49
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,070
各位旅客们好  我是你们的机长
Hi, folks. This is your captain.

50
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,120
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

51
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,310
本航班将于6小时24分钟后
Our flight time to Turks and Caicos

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,370

各乘务人员  准备起飞

54
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,120
好了
All right.

55
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,740
该吃罗纳多专门给咱在航班上吃的药了
‭Time to take that special flying medicine Ronaldo gave us.

56
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,950
是啊  这个"库达多"是什么意思
Yes, what does "Cuidado" mean?

57
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,490
好像是"安眠"的意思
I think it means "Sleep tight"?

58
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,490
{\an8}Cuidado实为西语"警告"的意思

59
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,060
-我也不知道  -好吧  一口闷
- I don't know. - ‭Oh, well, cheers!

60
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,110
祝您安眠
Cuidado.‭

Okay.

What happened?

63
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,370
我们已经降落了吗
Did we land?

64
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,530
这药效果也太好了
Oh, man, that stuff is good.

65
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,230
旅客们  我有个坏消息
Bad news, folks,

66
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,840
发生了一些机械故障
we have some mechanical issues.

67
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,420
我们需要返回登机口
We need to head back to the gate.

68
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,680
每当听到返回登机口
Okay, any time you head back to the gate,

69
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,090
就表示你航班不会起飞
that means your flight's not taking off.

70
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,200
好吧  拿好行李
All right, gather your things.

71
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,210
我们得赶紧换个航班
We're gonna need to scramble to find another one.

72
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,200
{\an8}五分钟可以发生许多事

73
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,690
普里契特先生  五分钟后
Okay, Mr. Pritchett, there is a connecting flight

74

75
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,300
如果二位尽快的话可以赶上
You can catch it if you hurry.

76
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,420
可我不想去达拉斯
I don't want to go to Dallas.

77
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,280
我们要去的是特克斯和凯科斯群岛
We're going to Turks and Caicos.

78
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,600
您在达拉斯转机而已
Dallas is just where you make your connection.

79
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,210
不好意思  我的大脑
I'm sorry, I'm having a really hard time

80
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,970
现在处理不了任何信息

81
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,670

等等  机票上怎么写着"达拉斯"
Wait, why do these say "Dallas"?

86
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,020
-我不知道  -女士
- I have no idea. ‭- Ma'am?

87
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,750
抱歉  我们遇到了严重问题

00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,230
我们想去的不是达拉斯
We don't want to go to Dallas.

89
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,050

Okay, we have to be at gate 4 in 32 minutes.

写就写
Okay.

她哪来这么大火气
Why is she so angry?

99
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,620
这不明摆着的吗  她对我有意思
Isn't it obvious? She's totally into me.

-不然怎么白送我记号笔  -有道理

想偷我的包没那么容易
Nice try stealing my bag.

111
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,390
你居然已经把包涂成别的颜色了
I see you've already painted it.

112
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,340
小卡  包又出现在你肩膀上了
Cam, it-it's back on your shoulder!

113
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,020
我的天  你可真是神乎其技
Oh, my God. You are good.

小卡  听我说听我说
Cam, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.

115

如果我们想平安抵达达拉斯
If we're gonna have any chance of getting to Dallas

116
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,120
并在那幸存下去  我们需要帽子

你能够告诉我你店里
Can you point me in the direction

哪个队的
What team?

124
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,280
{\an8}"为哪个队效力"常指性向是弯还是直

125
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,280
弯的  我不知道这和买帽子有什么关系
Gay -- I'm not sure why that's relevant.

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,190
你不上班的时候也戴帽子吗
When you're outside the workplace, do you wear hats?

130
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,420
还是那样会让你觉得
Or does that just kind of make you feel

131
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,940
你一直在上班
like you're always in the office?

132

这样吧  这些我全要了
Oh, you know what, I think I am going to get these.

米奇尔  你胳膊上怎么写着32
Mitchell, why do you have 32 written on your arm?

139
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
我不知道
I have no idea.

140
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,040
或许是什么密码  或许是我的年纪
Maybe it's some sort of code, or maybe it's my age.

141
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,580
你觉得我看起来像32岁吗
Do I look 32 to you?

142

实话实说  不  不要说实话
Tell me the truth. No, you know what -- don't.

143

如果我们写在手上  那肯定是很重要的事
Well, if we wrote it down, it must be something important.

144
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,420
我们该把其他看起来
Hey, we should write down other stuff

145
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,330
很重要的事也写下来  以免忘了

麻烦您快点
Please hurry. Okay.

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,900
到了
We're here.

-谢谢您  -太感谢您了

191
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,740
我们是米奇和小卡
Mitch and Cam.

192
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,480
您好  我们是米奇和小卡
Hi! ‭Hi! ‭Hi, we're Mitch and Cam!

193
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,900
我是米奇  他是小卡
I'm Mitch, he's Cam.

194
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,140
塔克先生  普里契特先生
Mr. Tucker, Mr. Pritchett --

195
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,690
你们刚好赶到
you made it just in time.

196
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,180
太好了  我的天
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

197
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,040
谢谢二位
Thank you.

198
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,900
露西  我们女儿的名字叫露西
Lucy, her name is Lucy.

199
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,390
我们回家来了  露西
We're coming home, Lucy!

200
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,760
各位  我们五分钟后
Hey, everyone, we are firing up the hologram

201
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,160
向进取号星舰发射全息图
to the Starship Enterprise in five minutes.

202
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,220
不来是傻子
Be there or be square.

203
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,810
我觉得去了也是傻子
I don't think he had to "or" that one.

204
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,170
亲爱的  现在我们到这里了
You know, honey, now that we're here,

205
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,530
我不确定擅自来找艾丽克斯是个好主意
I'm not sure it's such a great idea to barge in on Alex.

206
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,760
克莱尔  我担心她
Claire, I'm worried.

207
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,970
她不回我们短信
She's not returning texts.

208
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,670
她朋友说她从不出门
Her friend says she never goes out.

209
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,560
一生频道里讲到大学女生崩溃的电影中
This is the first act of every Lifetime movie

210
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,090
{\an8}美国首个为女性设计的电视频道

211
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,090
都是以此为序幕
about college girl meltdowns.

212
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,050
好吧  但我们或许该先跟她说一下
Yeah, but maybe we should give her a little head's up.

213
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,130
在"全优生到全忧生"中
That's what Alicia Silverstone's mom, Judith Light,

214
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,190
{\an8}该频道只有一部《全优生到女优生》
艾丽西娅·希尔维斯通与朱迪斯·萊特皆是名演员

215
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,190
艾丽西亚的妈妈朱迪斯一开始也这么觉得
thought in "From Straight A's to a Straight Jacket."

216
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,100
相信我  这是确保她没有
‭Trust me, this is the best way to make sure

217
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,720
晚上躲起来抑郁的最好方式
she's not spending her nights holed up and depressed.

218
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,060
艾丽克斯  宝贝  爸妈来了
Alex? Honey, it's Mom and Dad.

219
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,240
或许这是好现象
Oh, well, maybe this is a good sign.

220
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,970
或许她已经和朋友出去了  就像正常...
Maybe she's already out with friends, just like a normal --

221
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,710
你们怎么来了
What are you guys doing here?

222
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,040
想着来打声招呼  或许带你出去吃顿饭
Thought we'd pop by, say hi, maybe take you out for a bite.

223
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,530
除非你已经和一群有趣的人约好出去吃饭了
Unless you've already got fun group dinner plans?

224
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,030
我的玉米卷饼热好了
My burrito's ready.

225
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,350
你在喝酒吗
You're drinking?

226
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,030
有时酒能帮助我睡眠
Wine helps me sleep sometimes.

227
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,720
我真希望你们先打电话通知我
You know, I really wish you guys had called.

228
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,650
我现在忙着课业什么的
I'm so busy with school stuff right now,

229
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,430
这里也一团乱
and this place is a mess.

230
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,810
你在这里啊
Aww, there you are.

231
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,780
你买了猫吗
You got a cat?

232
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,010
-不是我的  -你偷了一只猫吗
- It's not mine. - You stole a cat?

233
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,280
就像"耶鲁生沦落监狱"的内芙·坎贝尔
Just like Neve Campbell in "From Yale to Jail."

234
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,100
{\an8}有这本书但没这部剧
内芙·坎贝尔是知名电视女演员

235
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,100
老天  宝贝  你真的没事吗
Oh, God. Honey, are you sure you're okay?

236
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,040
这是周六晚上
It's Saturday night.

237
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,810
你却穿着浴袍在喝酒
You're drinking wine in your bathrobe

238
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,720
还有一只来路不明的猫
with a come-from-nowhere cat.

239
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,600
这有什么问题吗
What's wrong with that?

240
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,570
不算猫的话  我基本和你一模一样啊
Take away the cat, and I'm basically you.

241
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,290
宝贝
‭Honey,

242
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,720
我懂在大学格格不入是什么感觉
I know what it's like to be an outsider in college.

243
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,570
我和校园风云人物过去常在他们门口
The cool kids and I used to try to make them feel better

244
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,560
留香蕉面包以使他们感觉好点
by leaving banana bread outside their door.

245
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,770
我们先敲门  然后跑开藏在灌木丛后面
We'd knock and then run off and hide behind a bush

246
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,850
就为了看看他们脸上的表情
and watch them just to see the expression on their faces --

247
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,620
菲尔
Phil.

248
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,660
你爸和我只是很担心
Your dad and I are just concerned

249
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,360
因为你最近有点疏远了
'cause you've been so distant lately.

250
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,660
我跟你们说了我最近忙
I told you I've been busy.

251
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,320
没人说你的生活不精彩
Nobody's saying you don't lead a full life.

252
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,170
你学习  做玉米卷饼
You study, you make burritos.

253
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,920
或许你只是有点寂寞或忧郁
Maybe -- maybe you're just a little lonely or depressed.

254
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,230
妈  我很好
I'm fine, mom.

255
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,970
我们随时都能接你回去治疗
'Cause we could always get you back into therapy.

256
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,080
-没错  -或者让你搬回家和我们住
- Yes. - Or have you move home with us.

257
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,200
天  别说了
God, stop.

258
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,140
为什么你们总把我想成忧郁的废柴
Why do you guys always just assume I'm some depressed loser?

259
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,020
你们有没有想过我疏远了
Did it ever occur to you that maybe I've been so distant

260
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,200
是因为我忙着自己的生活
because I've been busy with my own life?

261
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,570
或许我活得很好
Maybe I'm doing great.

262
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,600
或许是因为我和一个特别的人在一起
Maybe I'm spending time with someone special.

263
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,490
她说得对
That's right.

264
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,620
本  你做什么呢
Ben, what are you doing?

265
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,110
我跟你说了待在里面
I told you to stay in there.

266
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,670
对不起  我以为你在铺哏要来个大揭秘
I'm sorry -- I thought you were, like, building to a big reveal.

267
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,460
我没有
I wasn't.

268
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,700
你和本...  亲爱的  他50岁了吧
You and Ben and -- Honey, isn't he 50?

269
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,690
他26岁
He's 26.

270
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,580
这是家族遗传
It runs in my family.

271
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,490
我直到死都会长这样
I'm gonna look like this until the day I die.

272
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,020
所以你是因为这个才不回家的啊
So, this is why you haven't been coming home?

273
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,770
因为你在和你妈的助理交往
You've been dating your mom's assistant?

274
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,380
我其实是营销经理
I'm actually a marketing manager.

275
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,280
知道吗  或许你围条毛巾
You know what? This might go better for everyone

276
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,190
对大家都好
if you throw a towel on.

277
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,460
好的  有道理
Okay, yeah. That makes sense.

278
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,600
克莱尔  你能别解雇我吗
Claire, co-- um, could you not fire me?

279
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,010
你们偷偷约会多久了
Ugh, how long have you two been sneaking around?

280
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,110
几个月吧
A couple of months.

281
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,910
我去圣地亚哥时我们分了段时间
We took a break when I went to San Diego.

282
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,450
-什么  有吗  -别...
- What? We did? - ‭Just...

283
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,060
这样可以吗
Is this okay?

284
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,540
当然  我们就是为它准备的
Um, yeah, yeah, we put it in for her.

285
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,380
-这是猫食玉米卷饼  -等等
- It's a feline burrito. - Wait a minute.

286
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,550
我就知道我认得这家伙
I knew I recognized that thing.

287
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,430
你应该知道  他带猫上班
You should know -- he brings that cat to work

288
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,930
现在看来  连约会也带
and apparently on dates.

289
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,190
他觉得是时候让他生命中
He thought it was time to bring together

290
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,430
最特别的两个女性见面了
the two most special ladies in his life.

291
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,510
我可受不了每天上班
Well, I cannot go to work every day

292
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,200
都要想他脸上为什么露出蠢笑
and wonder why he's got that stupid smile on his face.

293
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,240
怎么这都成你的事了
Why are you making this all about you?

294
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,980
这是我第一段成人关系  就这一段
‭This is the first adult relationship I've had in... ever.

295
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,730
但这是和本啊
But it's with Ben.

296
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,400
没事的  没事的  她没有恶意
‭It's okay. It's okay. She didn't mean that.

297
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,690
克莱尔  我能和你谈谈吗
Claire, can I talk to you for a second?

298
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,640
你可以在大家面前赞同我啊
Oh, you can agree with me in front of everyone.

299
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
我其实觉得你有点小题大做了
Actually, I think you're overreacting a little.

300
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,440
-什么  -我们来的时候以为
- What? - We came here thinking

301
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,100
我们女儿陷入某种抑郁中
our daughter was in some sort of a depression,

302
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,540
结果她恋爱了
and it turns out she's dating someone.

303
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,320
而且他其实挺讨喜且无害的
And he's actually pretty sweet and harmless.

304
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,110
你是这样吗  本  无害吗
Are you, Ben? Are you harmless?

305
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,400
请不要  不要
Please don't, don't.

306
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,540
他亲了我
He kissed me.

307
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,900
-你亲了我妈  -你亲了我老婆
- You kissed my mom?! - You kissed my wife?!

308
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,190
我以为我不亲就会丢了工作
Dude, I thought I had to or I would lose my job, okay?

309
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,040
-不是...  -这是真的
- That's not... - ‭That's for real.

310
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,790
我们当时加班  只有我们两个人
We were working late. It was just the two of us.

311
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,840
她伸手来拿春卷  大概吧
She reached over to grab a spring roll, I guess,

312
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,870
但她就停在我脸前  小声说着
but she got right in my face, and she whispered,

313
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,900
"妈妈饿了"
"Mmm, Mama's hungry."

314
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,560
克莱尔  我得说  这可能是你的错
I have to say, Claire, this one might be on you.

315
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,460
说得像我会滥用职权占你便宜
Like I would abuse my position to take advantage of you

316
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,250
而不是占仓库的托尼便宜
and not Tony from the warehouse?

317
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,360
-仓库的托尼是谁  -就是...
- Who's Tony from the warehouse? - Just...

318
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,750
那个吻真的是个误会
The kiss was an honest mistake.

319
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,660
或许吧  但还是有点怪
Maybe, but it was still a little off,

320
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,020
而本的大多事情都挺怪
like most things are with Ben.

321
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,630
或许我就喜欢有点怪的  而且他还有很多面
Maybe I like a little off. And that's not all he is.

322
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,360
他是个很棒的人  而且莫名懂我
He's an amazing person who somehow gets me.

323
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,490
他很体贴  也聪明
He's thoughtful and smart,

324
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,750
我感觉在他身边能做自己
and I feel like i can be myself around him.

325
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,520
而且他睡觉时鼻子会小小抽动
And his nose does this little wiggly thing when he sleeps.

326
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,620
你看我睡觉吗
You watch me sleep?

327
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,860
我也看你睡觉
Dude, I watch you sleep.

328
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,660
我真开心我们的关系曝光了
I'm really glad that this is finally out

329
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,600
我能告诉别人我对你的感觉了
and I can tell people how I feel about you.

330
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,650
我真的喜欢你  本
I really like you, Ben.

331
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,570
很喜欢
Like, a lot.

332
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,060
我从没爱别人像爱你一样深
And I have never loved anyone as much as you.

333
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,740
-别说着说着就怪了  -好吧
- Don't make this weird. - Oh, yeah.

334
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,690
她没有伤心寂寞
She's not sad and lonely.

335
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,200
-没有  但是更糟  -瞧瞧她  克莱尔
- No, it's so much worse. - Look at her, Claire.

336
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,070
你见过她这么开心吗
Have you ever seen her look so happy?

337
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,170
靠
Crap.

338
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,640
3, 2, 1.

339
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,350
-你抓的是我的手  本  -对不起
- That's my hand, Ben. - Oh, sorry.

340
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,520
我的错
‭My bad.

341
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,290
加速  曼尼
Speed it up, Manny.

342
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,070
电影还有五分钟就开场了
The movie starts in five minutes.

343
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,260
抱歉  但我是不会时速超过32公里的
Sorry, but I'm not going over 20 miles an hour

344
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,380
因为卡布奇诺咖啡机没系安全带
with this cappuccino machine not strapped in.

345
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,070
一旦我练就了咖啡拉花技术
Once I perfect my foam art skills,

346
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,040
我的大一宿舍就是校园旺地了
my freshmen dorm will be the place to be.

347
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,800
我们可以再晚点跟他谈用"安全"措施了
I think we can put off that talk about using protection.

348
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,080
看  那里有一个车位
Mm, look, there's a spot right there.

349
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,080
看着悬  不过我还是试试吧
Looks tight, but I'll give it a try.

350
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,520
离路边太近了
You're too close to the curb.

351
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,010
要撞上了
You're gonna hit it.

352
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,710
我说什么来着
‭What'd I tell you?

353
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,340
没事的  乖儿子能做到
It's okay, Papi, you can do it.

354
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,020
绕过去
Go around.

355
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,020
有需要这样吗  你伸一根我还五根
Oh, really? Well, here's a bouquet of them!

356
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,770
好  我们再试一次
Okay, let's try this again.

357
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,400
够了  你下去  我来停车
Ugh, okay. Ah! Get out, I'll do it.

358
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,150
好"意外"哦
Surprise, surprise.

359
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,240
你刚刚说什么
What was that?

360
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,690
没什么  我是说我挺意外
Nothing, I was just saying that I am surprised

361
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,990
你像往常一样想要插手干涉
that you want to take over like you usually do.

362
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,100
-其实我不意外  -你这么指桑骂槐干嘛呢
- But I am not. - What are you cagey for?

363
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,930
我做错了什么
What did I do?

364
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,590
好吧  这个车位我停不进去
Okay, this spot's not happening.

365
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,650
我本来不想说的
Well, I didn't want to say anything,

366
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,610
但前几天  我们去杰夫和萨莉家时
but the other night, when we were at Jeff and Sally's,

367
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,690
我正在讲一个故事
I was in the middle of telling a story,

368
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,370
你就直接打断我  把结局说出来
you just took over and told the ending,

369
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,580
那样真的很没礼貌
and that was very rude.

370
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,560
这个车位好像不错  挺宽敞的
Okay, this one looks good -- It's huge.

371
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,190
你在气这个吗
That's what's bothering you?

372
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,720
我中途插入是为了救你
I jumped in to save you!

373
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,850
你都有点讲乱套
You were flailing.

374
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,140
快要被那些无关紧要的细节淹没了
You were drowning in a sea of unnecessary details.

375
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,060
怎么可能
‭Ah! How?!

376
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,200
我就喜欢那样说故事
That's the way I like to tell a story.

377
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,670
我喜欢巨细靡遗  更有画面感
I like to paint a picture.

378
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,530
讲故事就应该简短直接
A story should be short and simple.

379
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,560
不重要的细节不用告诉我
Don't tell me anything I don't need to know.

380
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,500
我是在带你踏上一段旅程
I am taking you on a journey.

381
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,200
而不是在教你如何组装书柜
I am not teaching you how to build a bookcase.

382
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,790
不是吧  你们明明看到我在等
Seriously? You saw me waiting.

383
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,330
就不能说一声你们不是要走吗
You couldn't tell me you weren't leaving?

384
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,430
你们记得自带购物袋
You brought your own shopping bags,

385
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,860
但却把礼貌忘在家里了
but you left your manners at home.

386
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,090
我只是想说  如果你想让故事好懂点
I'm just saying your story would be easier to follow

387
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,890
那就别一直讲岔题
if you didn't take so many side trips

388
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,760
并且再想想怎么架构你的故事
and you thought about the build a little bit.

389
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,410
你同意我说的吧  曼尼
You're with me on this, aren't you, Manny?

390
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,810
我喜欢妈妈说故事的方式
I like Mom's stories.

391
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,870
听到了没
See?

392
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,130
我就停这儿吧
I'm just gonna pull in here.

393
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,300
12块那么贵  难怪中产阶级那么愤怒
12 bucks? No wonder the middle class is so angry.

394
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,730
你绝对不可能听得懂她的故事
There's no way you would be able to follow her story.

395
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,650
他绝对听得懂
Yes, he would have.

396
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,870
好啊  你再说一遍
Fine. Tell it again.

397
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,680
几个礼拜前  我去逛超市
A couple of weeks ago, I go to the grocery store --

398
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,780
就是在华盛顿街
the one on Washington

399
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,090
右手边有个小小的红酒吧那一间
that has the tiny little wine bar to the right.

400
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,610
我进去后  就到处找纸巾
So, I come in, I'm looking for paper towels.

401
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,450
然后我想到  "我要犒劳一下自己
And I think, "Mmm, I'm gonna treat myself

402
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,060
喝点红酒吃点芝士"  有何不可呢
with some wine and some cheese." 'Cause why not?

403
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,820
于是我就去点了酒  然后我抬头时
So, I order my drink, and when I look up,

404
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,250
以为自己看到了桑德拉·布洛克
I thought I saw Sandra Bullock.

405
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,650
{\an8}美国知名女演员  代表作有《生死时速》《地心引力》

406
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,650
停  你刚刚说
Stop. Right there,

407
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,140
你以为自己看到了桑德拉·布洛克
you just said you thought you saw Sandra Bullock.

408
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,080
我已经知道结局了  不是她
I already know the ending. It wasn't her.

409
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,060
故事结束
End of story.

410
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,330
对  但你还不知道其实是谁
Yeah, but you don't even know who it really was.

411
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,590
但我已经知道不是桑德拉·布洛克
But I know it's not Sandra Bullock,

412
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,680
所以我不感兴趣了
so I'm not invested.

413
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,620
我很喜欢她在《地心引力》里的表演
You know, I really loved her in that movie "Gravity."

414
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,490
谁在乎啊  她当时又不在场
Who cares? She wasn't there.

415
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,060
拜托你是真的要走
Oh, please be leaving.

416
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,970
我能说完我的故事吗
May I finish my story?

417
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,550
于是  我就跟着桑德拉·布洛克...
So, I start following Sandra Bullock...

418
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,900
不是桑德拉·布洛克
Not Sandra Bullock.

419
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,610
...逛超市
...around the grocery store.

420
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,340
她先去了冷冻区
She goes first to the frozen section,

421
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,710
然后去了清洁用品区
then she goes to the detergent aisle.

422
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,500
我一路上盘算着
I'm thinking to myself this whole time,

423
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,140
"我要去跟她打招呼
"I am gonna go and introduce myself,

424
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,300
但是一定要选对时机"
but it has to be at the right time."

425
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,860
于是我继续跟着她
So I keep following her.

426
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,050
最后  她离开超市
Eventually, she leaves the store.

427
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,930
她走出门  外面挺热的
She goes outside, which was actually really hot

428
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,550
虽然是一月份  记得吗  因为去年...
to be January, because, remember, last year --

429
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,940
我们知道是几月  我们知道天气
We know the month, we know the weather,

430
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,380
我们知道不是桑德拉·布洛克
we know it's not Sandra Bullock.

431
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,570
你要走了吗
Are you leaving?

432
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,780
我想要你的停车位
I want your spot.

433
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,130
拜托
Oh, please.

434
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,960
别往自己脸上贴金了  小姐
Don't flatter yourself, lady.

435
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,080
曼尼  你有在听吗
Manny, are you listening?

436
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,710
没有  对不起  我没注意
No, sorry. I wasn't paying attention.

437
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,360
因为你吸引不了他的注意力
Because you're not holding his attention.

438
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,730
这就是我一直在说的
And this is what I've been talking about --

439
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,730
多余的细节太多了
too many useless details.

440
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,780
说重点吧
Get on with it.

441
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,560
然后她转过身  摘掉墨镜
So, she turns around, she takes her sunglasses off,

442
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,610
真的很诡异
which was really weird,

443
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,480
因为那副墨镜居然跟我去年买的
because it was the exact same pair

444
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,840
后来落在飞机上的那副一模一样
that I bought last year that I lost on that plane ride --

445
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,750
没人在乎你的破墨镜
Nobody cares about your sunglasses.

446
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,950
直接说结尾吧
Just get to the end.

447
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,420
我现在不想说了
I don't want to now.

448
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,440
那个女人转过身对你妈妈说
The woman turns to your mother and says,

449
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,200
"天啊  你是莎尔玛·海雅克吗"
"Oh, my God. Are you Salma Hayek?"

450
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,200
{\an8}墨西哥知名女星  代表作《弗里达》

451
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,950
有车位了
Here we go.

452
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,380
我只是想帮你
I'm just trying to help you.

453
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,490
打方向灯  看后视镜
Put on blinker, check mirrors,

454
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,000
注意抢停车位的混蛋
watch jerk steal your spot,

455
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,980
后悔四年级时就放弃练空手道了
regret quitting karate in 4th grade.

456
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,520
你知道吗  杰  重点不是
You know what, Jay, this is not about

457
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,960
谁的故事比较精彩
who tells the best story.

458
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,680
而是你那天晚上打断我
This is about you jumping in that night

459
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,790
好像你不希望我说下去
like you just wanted me to stop talking because

460
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,430
因为我让你丢脸了一样
I was embarrassing you or something.

461
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,260
你让我觉得自己好蠢
You made me feel stupid.

462
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,510
你觉得这没什么  但我觉得很受伤
You think it's nothing, but you hurt my feelings.

463
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,090
歌洛莉亚  让你受伤是我最不愿见到的事
Gloria, that's the last thing I meant to happen.

464
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,500
你只是口头说说  你不是真的明白
You're just saying that. You don't really understand.

465
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,730
我是不明白  抱歉
No, I'm sorry.

466
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,020
最不想让别人觉得自己说话
Hell, I'm the last guy who wants to make somebody

467
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,660
很蠢的人  就是我了
feel like they sound stupid.

468
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,500
我有没有跟你提过  以前住我家附近
Did I ever tell you about the little boy

469
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,150
讲话结巴的那个小男孩
from my neighborhood who stuttered?

470
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,720
他为此很自卑
He was real self-conscious about it.

471
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,980
哪个孩子不会呢
What kid wouldn't be?

472
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,470
上课时  老师向他提问
At school, when the teacher would ask him a question,

473
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,590
他很努力想说出答案
he tried so hard to get the words out,

474
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,110
但就是说不出来
but it just wouldn't come.

475
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,600
其他孩子都看着他
Rest of the kids stared at him,

476
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,410
他反而更结巴了
which only made the stuttering worse.

477
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,670
他们在背后笑话他
They'd whisper behind his back and laugh.

478
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,940
最后发展到老师叫他回答问题时
Finally, got to the point when the teacher called on him

479
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,830
他即便知道答案
to answer a question, even if he knew the answer,

480
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,040
也说  "我不会"
he'd just say, "I don't know."

481
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,410
然后老师就会摇摇头  说
Then the teacher would shake his head and say,

482
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,580
"下次要更努力学习  杰"
"Next time, study harder, Jay."

483
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,930
你就是那个小男孩
You were that little kid?

484
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,750
好可怜
So sad.

485
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,010
你那时一定很难过
That must have been very hard for you.

486
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,960
的确
It was.

487
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,270
车停好了
We're parked.

488
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,500
好了  电影快开始了
Okay, the movie's about to start.

489
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,770
我们走吧
Let's go.

490
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,760
我有好多年没想起过那件事了
Man, I haven't thought about that in years.

491
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,120
真的很感人
That was really moving.

492
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,080
因为这才是正确的讲故事方式
'Cause that's how you tell a story.

493
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,310
你好  你能不能在五分钟之内
Hi, could you bring out the birthday cake

494
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,550
把生日蛋糕拿出来
in like five, minutes?

495
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,010
没问题  你想要我们唱生日歌吗
Sure, do you want the whole song and everything?

496
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,290
-能唱就最好了  -我问你纯粹是因为
- Oh, that would be great. - I only ask because

497
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,140
-我们不想唱  -好吧  谢谢
- we don't love doing it. - Okay, thanks.

498
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,330
你好吗  小寿星
Hey. ‭So, birthday boy,

499
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,630
心情如何啊
how you feeling?

500
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,640
说实话  有点紧张
Um, a little nervous, actually.

501
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,460
为什么
Why?

502
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,350
其实吧
Uh, well.

503
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,040
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

504
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,540
海莉  我今早醒来时
Haley, when I woke up this morning,

505
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,400
就有股浓烈的感情涌上心头
I just had this feeling.

506
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,910
我知道这很突然
And I know this is sudden,

507
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,370
但是如同每个中大型频道的天气预报员
but like any mid-to-large market weatherman,

508
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,760
我相信自己的直觉
I trust my instincts.

509
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,950
可能也和我快到45岁有点关系
And it might have something to do with turning 45,

510
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,500
但今天我的直觉告诉我  不要再浪费时间
but today my instincts told me not to wait another second

511
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,970
我想和我爱的女人共度余生
to spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.

512
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,420
海莉·格温多林·邓菲  你愿意嫁给我吗
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you marry me?

513
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,990
我愿意
Yes.

514
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,870
-我愿意嫁给你  -真的吗  你愿意嫁给我
- Yes, I'll marry you. - Really? You will?

515
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,910
真的
Yeah! 

516
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,050
就是感觉对了  你懂吗
It just feels right, you know?

517
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,390
我不想要想太多
I don't want to over-think it.

518
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,410
我喜欢的就是你这点
That's what I love about you.

519
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,770
你任何事都不会想太多
You don't over-think anything.

520
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,520
你让我成为了世上最幸福的男人
Oh, you've made me the happiest man in the world.

521
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,450
我不知道这话怎么说才不会显得贪财
I don't know how to say this without sounding superficial,

522
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,730
但我想好好看看这戒指
but I need a closer look at this ring.

523
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,080
没问题  坐  坐吧
Yeah, sit down, sit down.

524
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,220
这是我奶奶传下来的
It was my grandmother's.

525
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,000
她当年在大萧条时期时把戒指
She hid it in her hollowed-out wooden foot

526
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,040
藏在挖空的木头假腿里
during the Great Depression.

527
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,570
震惊  我奶奶居然在大朋友圈
So crazy my grandmother's on Snapchat.

528
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,660
太美了
It's beautiful.

529
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,240
我这样不会破坏了惊喜吧
I didn't ruin the surprise, did I?

530
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,830
我本来是想装没事到吃完晚餐
I mean, I was trying to act normal through dinner.

531
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,500
但我实在藏不住内心的紧张
I just couldn't hide how nervous I was.

532
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,160
我想粉丝们走近跟我说话时  也是这心情吧
It's how I imagine fans feel when they come up and meet me.

533
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,070
没破坏  我完全没预料到
No, I didn't expect it at all.

534
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,600
我本来以为你紧张是因为
I just thought you were nervous because the light's

535
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,650
灯光打在了你右脸上
on the right side of your face.

536
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,400
对啊  你看看我
Yeah. Oh, look at me --

537
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,940
嘴都不自觉在笑了
I can't stop smiling. ‭Yeah!

538
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,030
我通常都是把笑容留到镜头前
Usually I like to save my smiles for on-camera

539
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,440
因为这样会显得笑容比较真
because they come off more real that way.

540
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,360
但为此而笑太值了
Oh, yeah. ‭But this is worth it.

541
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,980
-奇了怪了  -怎么了
- That's odd. - ‭What's wrong?

542
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,750
下雨了
It's raining.

543
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,860
我没有预料到  我报了今晚晴朗呢
I didn't predict that -- I called for clear skies tonight.

544
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,990
我们要不要点个香槟来庆祝一下
Ooh, should we order some champagne to celebrate?

545
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,580
真不敢相信我的预报错了
I can't believe my forecast was wrong.

546
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,380
别太苛责自己了
Oh, don't beat yourself up about it.

547
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,690
我的气象预报应用也没预测到下雨啊
If it helps, my weather app didn't predict rain either.

548
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,840
-你的什么  -没什么
- Your what? - ‭Nothing.

549
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,330
天啊  看看那大风
My God, look at those winds.

550
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,090
这起码是10级的暴风啊
They must register at least a 10 on the Beaufort Scale.

551
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,000
看看那些没关上的天窗
Think of all the sun roofs left open.

552
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,360
想想那些刚吹好的发型塌下来
Think of all the freshly blown-out hair de-volumizing.

553
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,570
我怎么能没预判到这个呢
How could I not see this coming?

554
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,230
雷纳
Rainer.

555
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,920
这是我今天唯一错判的事吗
Is this the only thing I was off about today?

556
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,220
你什么意思
What do you mean?

557
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,440
海莉  别自欺欺人了  我没有好好想清楚
Well, let's face it, Haley. I did not think this through.

558
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,720
我们婚后住哪里啊
I mean, where are we gonna live?

559
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,450
我家只有一个步入式衣帽间  它会维持是我的
My place only has one walk-in closet, which would stay mine.

560
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,700
我的女儿会对我们结婚这事有何想法
And how's my daughter gonna feel about us getting married?

561
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,170
你会想要有孩子吗
Are you gonna want to have children?

562
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,740
我还有办法播种吗
Can I even have more children?

563
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,650
我去照过很多次日光浴床呢
I've spent a lot of time in tanning beds.

564
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,070
我觉得你有点懵了
Um, I think you're spinning a little.

565
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,190
听我说  有时候当我在重新整理衣柜时
Look, sometimes when I'm reorganizing my closet,

566
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,960
我也会有手足无措感  觉得好像永远收不完
I feel overwhelmed, like I'm never gonna get through it all.

567
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,500
所以我逼自己把事情分成一小块一小块
So I force myself to look at things in smaller sections.

568
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,760
比如一次整理五双鞋子
I arrange five pairs of shoes at a time.

569
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,970
12小时后  我就完事啦
12 hours later, I'm done.

570
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,330
所以我们也来这么做
So, that's what we'll do.

571
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,270
我们把事情分成5年  5年来处理
We'll take things five years at a time.

572
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,110
-5年后我就要50岁啦  -什么
- In five years, I'll be 50. - What?

573
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,950
你本来觉得45加5等于多少
What did you think 45 plus 5 was?

574
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,780
今天之前我一直当你是44岁
Well, until today, you were 44,

575
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,010
然后我洗脑了自己你四舍五入是40岁
which I had basically convinced myself was 40,

576
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,760
结果突然就成了50岁  四舍五入就是60岁
and now suddenly we're talking about 50, which is basically 60.

577
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,150
你有什么好恐慌的
Why are you panicking?

578
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,130
我才是不容再有一次失败婚姻的人
I'm the one who can't mess up another marriage.

579
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,130
你看  第一次婚姻失败  没关系
I mean, you mess up the first one, fine.

580
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,950
表现不好能重来  但第二次又失败
It's a mulligan. But the second one fails,

581
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,650
我就是婚姻失败的凶手了
and suddenly I'm the problem.

582
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,510
我也就失去了成为
I lose my chance at being the spokesperson

583
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,400
韩国蓝台风能量饮料代言人的资格
for Blue Monsoon Korean Energy Drink.

584
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,740
让我们先缓口气
Let's just take a breath.

585
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,290
稍微有点惊慌失措是很正常的
It's natural to freak out a little bit.

586
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,700
毕竟我们在做的是一生的承诺
We're making a lifetime commitment.

587
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,770
我们要一辈子永不分离
We're going to be together forever.

588
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,620
就我跟你俩人  永不分离
Just you and me. Forever.

589
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,450
你这话重复说了
You just said that.

590
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,590
我知道啊
I know.

591
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,750
因为...  因为这太棒了
Because -- because it's great.

592
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,220
每个女都孩梦寐以求  对吧
That's what every girl wants, right?

593
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,920
的确  我还是花季少女  而世界上
I mean, sure, I'm still really young and there's obviously

594
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,170
也还有许多我想先去做完
so much more I thought I'd do before I tied myself down

595
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,990
再跟某个人定下来的事情
to one person for the rest of my life.

596
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,830
但有谁会真的觉得自己准备好结婚了啊
But does anyone ever truly feel ready to get married?

597
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,060
大概吧
I mean, probably.

598
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,620
-海莉  -但我也不是要死掉
- Haley. - But it's not like I'm dying.

599
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,420
只不过是不会再单身而已
I just won't be single anymore.

600
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,980
再也不会跟人初次约会
I'll won't ever go on a first date again.

601
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,180
再也不会跟人初吻
I won't ever have a first kiss.

602
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,550
再也不会在DJ台附近跳舞
I won't ever dance near a deejay booth

603
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,680
然后在心里祈祷有人欣赏
hoping someone will like what they see

604
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,280
然后愿意载我回家
and offer me a ride home.

605
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,060
天啊  是...  是我的问题
Oh, my -- is it - is it me?

606
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,760
还是这餐厅里超热
Or is it just crazy hot in here?

607
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,400
麻烦谁开一下窗子可以吗
Can somebody open a window, please?

608
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,230
不  他们不能开  如我所没预料到的  
No, no, they can't because, as I did not predict,

609
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,410
外面正在刮风下雨
it's raining outside.

610
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,160
我的手指肿起来了
Ew, my finger is swelling up.

611
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,150
为什么你奶奶的大萧条戒指这么紧啊
Oh, why is your grandmother's Depression ring so tight?

612
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,140
把黄油给我
Give me that butter.

613
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,490
来  我来帮忙你
Here, let me help you with that.

614
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,820
我拔啦
I got it.

615
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,460
-天啊  对不起  -没  没关系
- Ow! ‭Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. ‭- Nope, it's okay.

616
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,240
我没事
I'm fine.

617
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,610
至少戒指拔下来了
At least the ring came off.

618
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,240
对啊  感觉好多了
Yeah, um, feels better.

619
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,670
听我说  或许你是对的
Look, um, maybe you're right.

620
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,750
或许我们应该重新琢磨一下结婚这事
Maybe we should rethink this whole marriage thing.

621
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,870
我不记得说过这话啊
I don't remember saying that.

622
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,360
很明显你心里还有疑虑
